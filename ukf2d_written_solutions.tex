  z \\
  \dot z
  \end{bmatrix}

\subsection{Prediction Step}

\subsubsection{Control Input}

\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{u} = \begin{bmatrix}
  \ddot z
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{State Transition Function}

\begin{equation}
  g(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{u}, \Delta t) = \begin{bmatrix}
  \todo{?} & \todo{?} \\
  \todo{?} & \todo{?}
  \end{bmatrix}\mathbf{x} + \begin{bmatrix}
  \todo{?} \\
  \todo{?}
  \end{bmatrix}\mathbf{u}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Measurement Update Step}

\subsubsection{Measurement Vector}

\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{z}_t = \begin{bmatrix}
  r
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Measurement Function}

\begin{equation}
  h(\mathbf{\bar x}) = \begin{bmatrix}
  \todo{?} & \todo{?}
  \end{bmatrix}\mathbf{\bar x}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Measurement Covariance Matrix}

Populate the measurement covariance matrix $\mathbf{R}$ with a reasonable value for the variance $\sigma^2_r$ of the range reading $r$.

\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{R} = \begin{bmatrix}
  \todo{?}
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
